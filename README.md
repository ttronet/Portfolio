This is a repository with all my personal projects.

1 - AppleWormGame: Here, you can see an Apple Worm's 3D version Game, this game has been made it with openGL, SDL and some extras libraries. You can view the images, 3D models, textures, sounds and more.\
To play you just need to download the repo and then, open the ViboritaGame.exe.

**notes:**\
This was a computer graphics course's project with two months of work made by me and other coworker, and this is the v1.0, so, it's has bugs.
